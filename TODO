 * BUG: really short rows get stitches outside bounds
 * pattern-based fill?
 * curved fill?
 * extension to split a fill region into sub-regions that can each be embroidered all in one go
 * extension to generate various kinds of underlay for selected paths
   * center line
   * edge walk
   * sparse fill rotated 90 degrees
 * extension to generate connection between two patches
   * user will probably adjust, but then the endpoints are in the right spots
 * setting for fill to tell it where to start (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)
 * keep stitch plan objects and just update the ones that change
   * use md5sum of <path> objects to see what's changed
   * keep stitch plans in a layer above everything else
   * set stitch plans to "noninteractive" so you can click through them to the paths
   * this will make it work more like a "real" embroidery program
 * use a GUI dialog in params script to load existing settings, making it more like a real app
 * separate 'export embroidery file' command
 * get rid of TSP entirely and make it completely human-driven
 * add option for connection to next patch (jump or running stitch)
